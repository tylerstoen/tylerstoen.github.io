The purpose of the graph is to showcase that the current median age of both chambers is the oldest it has ever been, as described in the title of the graph. The current median age in the Senate is about 65 while the median age in the House of Representatives is about 58. In the article posted on fivethirtyeight, it mentions that this may be a concern, as older politicians tend to be relatively unfamiliar with modern technology.\nIn my opinion, the graph does a good job showing that, in recent years, the median age of both chambers has been the oldest, at least in the range of the data. By quickly glancing at the graph, it is clear that the highest point in the graph is further to the right (more recent). Although I would likely not choose to use a step graph for this visualization, it works well as you are able to see which parts of the graph represent a new term. The addition of the label for the median age of the most recent year is also a nice touch to make it more clear how old the chambers have really become. Also, the graph does a good job citing sources and even includes what was done when a member served in both chambers. In my opinion, the text under the graph is a bit lengthy and including that elsewhere, such as in the article itself, may have been a better choice to reduce the amount of visual clutter in the graph. The y-axis label was also changed into a “subtitle” to make it easier to read. The titles is descriptive and gives the reader insight on what to expect in the graph."
